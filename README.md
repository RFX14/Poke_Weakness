# Poke_Weakness
A simple app that gives a user a visual representation of the types a Pokemon is very weak or very strong against

This app was made as way for me to learn about the following:
  -RESTFUL APIs: Learned what they are and how to use them.
  -MVC Architechture: Learned a better way of organizing and writing code
  -Delegate Pattern: Learned how to manage states
  -UICollectionView: Learned how to use this compared to TableView
